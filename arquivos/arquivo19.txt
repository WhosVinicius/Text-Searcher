Look I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings 
But Im only going to get this one chance 
Somethings wrong I can feel it 
For six minutes Slim Shady youre on 
Just a feeling Ive got like somethings about to happen 
But I dont know what 

If that means what I think it means 
Were in trouble big trouble 
And if he is as bananas as you say 
Im not taking any chances 
You were just what the doc ordered 

Im beginning to feel like a rap God rap God 
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod 
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox slapbox 
They said I rap like a robot so call me Rapbot 

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes 
I got a laptop in my back pocket 
My penll go off when I halfcock it 
Got a fat knot from that rap profit 
Made a living and a killing off it 
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office 
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack 
Im an MC still as honest 
But as rude and as indecent as all hell 
Syllables skillaholic kill em all with 
This flippity dippityhippity hiphop 
You dont really wanna get into a pissing match 
With this rappityrap 
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac 
Backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack 

And at the exact same time 
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing that 
Ill still be able to break a mothafuckin table 
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half 
Only realized it was ironic 
I was under Aftermath after the fact 
How could I not blow 
All I do is drop Fbombs 
Feel my wrath of attack 
Rappers are having a rough time period 
Heres a maxipad 
Its actually disastrously bad for the wack 
While Im masterfully constructing this master piece 

Im beginning to feel like a rap God rap God 
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod 
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox slapbox 
Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard 

Everybody want the key and the secret 
To rap immortality like I have got 
Well to be truthful the blueprints 
Simply rage and youthful exuberance 
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance 
Hit the earth like an asteroid 
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since 
MCs get taken to school with this music 
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme 
Now I lead a new school full of students 

Me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz 2Pac 
NWA Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim 
Inspired enough to one day grow up 
Blow up and be in a position to meet Run DMC and induct them 
Into the mothafuckin Rock n Roll Hall of Fame 
Even though Ill walk in the church 
And burst in a ball of flames 
Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in 
Is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame 
You fags think its all a game 
Til I walk a flock of flames off a plank 
And tell me what in the fuck are you thinking 

Little gaylooking boy 
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy 
Youre witnessing a massoccur 
Like youre watching a church gathering take place looking boy 
Oy vey that boys gay thats all they say looking boy 
You get a thumbs up pat on the back 
And a way to go from your label every day looking boy 
Hey looking boy what you say looking boy 
I get a hell yeah from Dre looking boy 
Ima work for everything I have never ask nobody for shit 
Get outta my face looking boy 
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable 
To keep it up with the same pace looking boy 

Cause Im beginning to feel like a rap God rap God 
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod 
The way Im racing around the track call me Nascar Nascar 
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God 
Kneel before General Zod this planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard 

So you be Thor and Ill be Odin 
You rodent Im omnipotent 
Let off then Im reloading immediately 
With these bombs Im toting 
And I should not be woken Im the walking dead 
But Im just a talking head a zombie floating 
But I got your mom deep throating 

Im out my Ramen Noodle 
We have nothing in common poodle 
Im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm 
And pay homage pupil 
Its me my honestys brutal but its honestly futile 
If I dont utilize what I do though 
For good at least once in a while 

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch 
I scribble and doodle enough rhymes 
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times 
But I gotta keep a few punchlines 
Just in case cause even you unsigned rappers 
Are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime 
I know there was a time 
Where once I was king of the underground 
But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind 
So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine 

Appeal with the skin color of mine 
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you 
Like that one line I said on Im Back from the Mathers LP 
One when I tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine 
Put em all in a line add an AK47 a revolver and a nine 

See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was 
But Im morphing into an immortal coming through the portal 
Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though 
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for 
Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows 
You write normal Fuck being normal 

And I just bought a new raygun from the future 
Just to come and shoot you 
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweathers pad 
Singing to a man while they played piano 

Man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel 
So Ray J went straight to the radio station 
The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you 
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed JJ Fad 

Uh summalumma doomalumma you assuming Im a human 
What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman 
Innovative and Im made of rubber 
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me 
And itll glue to you 

And Im devastating more than ever demonstrating 
How to give a mothafuckin audience a feeling like its levitating 
Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting 
For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating 
Cause I know the way to get em motivated 
I make elevating music you make elevator music 

Oh hes too mainstream 
Well thats what they do when they get jealous 
They confuse it 
Its not hiphop its pop 
Cause I found a hella way to fuse it with rock 
Shock rap with Doc 

Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it 
I dont know how to make songs like that 
I dont know what words to use 
Let me know when it occurs to you 
While Im ripping any one of these verses 
That versus you its curtains 
Im inadvertently hurting you 
How many verses I gotta murder to 

Prove that if you were half as nice your songs 
You could sacrifice virgins too 
School flunky pill junky 
But look at the accolades these skills brung me 
Full of myself but still hungry 
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to 
And Im a million leagues above you 
Ill when I speak in tongues 

But its still tongue in cheek fuck you 
Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel 
Im asleep in the front seat 
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz 
Still chunky but funky 
But in my head theres something 
I can feel tugging and struggling 
Angels fight with devils 
And heres what they want from me 

Theyre asking me to eliminate some of the women hate 
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had 
Then you may be a little patient 
And more sympathetic to the situation 
And understand the discrimination 

But fuck it lifes handing you lemons 
Make lemonade then but if I cant batter the women 
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then 
Dont mistake him for Satan its a fatal mistake 
If you think I need to be overseas 
And take a vacation to trip abroad 
And make her fall on her face 
And dont be a retard 
Be a king Think not 
Why be a king when you can be a God
