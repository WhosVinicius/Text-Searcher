Me and Kurt feel the same 
Too much pleasure is pain 
My girl spites me in vain 
All I do is complain 
She needs something to change 
Need to take off the eeedge 
So fuck it all tonight 
And dont tell me to shut up 
When you know you talk too much 
But you dont got shit to say say 

I want you out of my head 
I want you out of my bedroom tonight bedroom 
Theres no way I could save you save you 
Cause I need to be saved too 
Im no good at goodbyes 

Were both actin insane 
But too stubborn to change 
Now Im drinkin again 
Eighty proof in my veins 
And my fingertips stained 
Looking over the eeedge 
Dont fuck with me tonight 

Say you needed this heart then you got it got it 
Turns out that it wasnt what you wanted wanted 
And we wouldnt let go and we lost it 
Now Im a goner 

I want you out of my head head 
I want you out of my bedroom tonight bedroom 
Theres no way I could save you save you 
Cause I need to be saved too saved too 
Im no good at goodbyes 

Young Thug 
I want you out of my life 
I want you back here tonight 
Im tryna cut you no knife 
I wanna slice ya and dice ya 
My argue possessive aint got you precise 
Can you not turn off the TV Im watchin a fight 
I flooded a garage blue diamond no shark 
Youre barbie life doll its Nicki Minaj 
You dont need a key to drive your car on a charger 
I just wanna see the side the one thats unbothered yeah 
And I dont want you to ever go outside side 
But I promise if they play my niggas slidin slidin 
Im fuckin her and the tour bus still ridin ride in

I want you out of my head head 
I want you out of my bedroom tonight bedroom 
Theres no way I could save you save you 
Cause I need to be saved too saved too 
Im no good at goodbyes 

Goodbye goodbye goodbye 
Goodbye goodbye goodbye 
Goodbye goodbye goodbye 
Im no good at goodbyes 

Goodbye goodbye goodbye 
Goodbye goodbye goodbye 
Goodbye goodbye goodbye 
Im no good at goodbyes
