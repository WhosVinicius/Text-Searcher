House so empty need a centerpiece 
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony 
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces 
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby 
Youre talking money need a hearing aid

No competition I dont really listen 
Im in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

Let a nigga Brad Pitt 
Legend Of the Fall took the year like a bandit 
Bought mama a crib and a brandnew wagon 
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish 
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan 
Girls get loose when they hear this song 
One hundred on the dash get me close to God 
We dont pray for love we just pray for cars 

House so empty need a centerpiece 
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
