Yeah 

Ive been tryna call 
Ive been on my own for long enough 
Maybe you can show me how to love maybe 
Im going through withdrawals 
You dont even have to do too much 
You can turn me on with just a touch baby 

I look around and 
Sin citys cold and empty oh 
No ones around to judge me oh 
I cant see clearly when youre gone 

I said Ooh Im blinded by the lights 
No I cant sleep until I feel your touch 
I said Ooh Im drowning in the night 
Oh when Im like this youre the one I trust 
Hey hey hey 

Im running out of time 
Cause I can see the Sun light up the sky 
So I hit the road in overdrive baby oh 

The citys cold and empty oh 
No ones around to judge me oh 
I cant see clearly when youre gone 

I said Ooh Im blinded by the lights 
No I cant sleep until I feel your touch 
I said Ooh Im drowning in the night 
Oh when Im like this youre the one I trust 

Im just coming back to let you know back to let you know 
I can never say it on the phone say it on the phone 
Will never let you go this time ooh 

I said Ooh Im blinded by the lights 
No I cant sleep until I feel your touch 
Hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey 

I said Ooh Im blinded by the lights 
No I cant sleep until I feel your touch
