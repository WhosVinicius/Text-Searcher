Your man on the road he doin promo 
You said Keep our business on the lowlow 
Im just tryna get you out the friend zone 
Cause you look even better than the photos 
I cant find your house send me the info 
Drivin through the gated residential 
Found out I was comin sent your friends home 
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know 

I only call you when its half past five 
The only time that Ill be by your side 
I only love it when you touch me not feel me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me yeah 

I only fuck you when its half past five 
The only time Id ever call you mine 
I only love it when you touch me not feel me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me babe 

Ima let you know and keep it simple 
Tryna keep it up dont seem so simple 
I just fucked two bitches fore I saw you 
And you gon have to do it at my tempo 
Always tryna send me off to rehab 
Drugs started feelin like its decaf 
Im just tryna live life for the moment 
And all these motherfuckers wanna relapse 

I only call you when its half past five 
The only time that Ill be by your side 
I only love it when you touch me not feel me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me yeah 

I only fuck you when its half past five 
The only time Id ever call you mine 
I only love it when you touch me not feel me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me babe 

Hills have eyes the hills have eyes 
Who are you to judge 
Who are you to judge 
Hide your lies girl hide your lies 
Only you to trust only you 

I only call you when its half past five 
The only time that Ill be by your side 
I only love it when you touch me not feel me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me yeah 

I only fuck you when its half past five 
The only time Id ever call you mine 
I only love it when you touch me not feel me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me 
When Im fucked up thats the real me babe
