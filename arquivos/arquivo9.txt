Swae Lee 
Needless to say I keep her in check 
She was all badbad nevertheless 
Calling it quits now baby Im a wreck 
Crash at my place baby youre a wreck 
Needless to say I keep her in check 
She was all badbad nevertheless 
Callin it quits now baby Im a wreck 
Crash at my place baby youre a wreck 
Thinking in a bad way losing your grip 
Screaming at my face baby dont trip 
Someone took a big L I dont know how that felt 
Looking at you sideways party on tilt 
Some things you just cant refuse 
Then youre left in the dust 
Unless I stuck by ya 
Youre a sunflower 
I think your love would be too much 
Or youll be left in the dust 
Unless I stuck by ya 
Youre the sunflower 
Youre the sunflower 
Every time Im leaving on ya 
You dont make it easy no 
Wish I could be there for you 
Give me a reason to go 
Every time Im walking out 
I can hear you telling me to turn around 
Fighting for my trust and you wont back down 
Even if we gotta risk it all right now oh 
I know youre scared of the unknown 
You dont wanna be alone 
I know I always come and go 
But its out of my control 
And youll be left in the dust 
Unless I stuck by ya 
Youre the sunflower 
I think your love would be too much 
Or youll be left in the dust 
Unless I stuck by ya 
Youre the sunflower 
Youre the sunflower
